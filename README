# midi-cc-keyboard

There were no basic projects out there to simply test MIDI CC commands.
So here is my quick hacked-up project.


# Instructions

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-tk
$ pip3 install python-rtmidi
$ git clone https://github.com/obbardc/midi-cc-keyboard
$ ./midi-cc-keyboard
```
